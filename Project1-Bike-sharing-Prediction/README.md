# Bike Sharing Prediction

Completing this project, I have learned neural networks basics and built with Python and Numpy. I have defined and trained a multi-layer deep neural network, and used it to predict the bike sharing data. Here, I have built and trained a neural network from scratch.

Instructions
______
1. First, you can download or clone this repository. For cloning this repository use: `git clone https://github.com/ashishsth7586/udacity-deeplearning-nanodegree.git`
2. cd into the `Project1-Bike-sharing-Prediction` directory.
3. Make sure you have python virtual environment installed or you can use anaconda.
4. Create a new python virtual environment: `virtualenv -p python3 <environment-name>`
5. Activate your conda environment: `Linux: $~ source <environment-name>/bin/activate`
6. Ensure you have `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Jupyter Notebook` installed. You can install by using the command: `pip install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyterlab`
7. Run the following to open up the notebook server after activating the virtual environment: `jupyter-notebook`
8. In your browser, open bike-sharing-neural-network.ipynb
9. Follow the instructions in the notebook; it will lead you through the project. You'll ultimately be editing the bike-sharing-neural-net.py file, from where required functions for training the nn are imported into the notebook.
