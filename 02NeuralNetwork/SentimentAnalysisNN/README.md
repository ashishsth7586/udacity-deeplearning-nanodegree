# Sentiment Analysis using Multi-layered Perceptron

This project on Sentiment analysis using MLP was guided by Andrew Trask (http://iamtrask.github.io).

Here, Andrew has introduced a technique to classify the sentiment(Postive or Negative) analysis on IMDB's movie reviews dataset. He has also taught a way to frame problems for  a Neural Network and divided the entire project into six mini projects where I was able to learn curating a dataset, transforming text to numbers, building a neural network from scratch, reducing neural noise and analyzing the inefficencies that cause as a result of  redundant and unnecessary mathematical operations.
